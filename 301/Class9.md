What is immutability?
 It  can reduced memory usage, immutability allows you to optimize your application by making use of reference- and value equality.
  This makes it really easy to see if anything has changed.
 For example a state change in a react component.


- What is Referential transparency?
Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs.

 a collection of new features when used it in js .

 - What does the word ‘require’ do ? 
 1. used to load and cache in js modules.

  var arthmetic = require("arthmetic");
  Node JS Module. Import Node JS
