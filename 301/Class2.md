## State and Props

### Converting a Function to a Class:
1. import React from 'react'
1. class App extends React.Component
1. render()
1. return
1. contain element in div
1. this.props for passing values

#### Handling Events  
* Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:  
* React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.  
* With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
