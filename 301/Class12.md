|use structured query language and have a predefined schema| databases have dynamic schemas for |unstructured data. 
|are better for multi-row transactions| are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.|
|databases are table based databases  |databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
