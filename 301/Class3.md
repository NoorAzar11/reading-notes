## Readings: Passing Functions as Props


#### Lists and Keys in react 

- Map : The map() function applies a given to function to each item of an iterable and returns a list of the results. 

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React? 
The map() method is the most commonly used function to iterate over an array of data in JSX. 
- 

In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript. ... The map() function is used for traversing the lists.

### The Spread Operator

What is the spread operator?

The Spread operator lets you expand an iterable like an object, string, or array into its elements while the Rest operator does the inverse by reducing a set of elements into one array.

- List 4 things that the spread operator can do?
1. Copying an array.
2. Concatenating or combining arrays.
3. Using Math functions.
4. Using an array as arguments.
5. Adding an item to a list.

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays. ?

First, declare an empty array and then use the push() method with the spread operator. The contents of the arrays will be copied in the desired array

In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical.
