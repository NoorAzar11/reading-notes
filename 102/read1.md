<h1> Linux 

as a graphical user interface made to make every thing easier for us ,also you can open multiple commends and use them for 
many things such as working on terminal or to bring ancillary data  and to  viewing Manual pages.

you can enter your commends and its gonna display after your done .
so if we entered ls it will bring the directory and files ,and if we use -l its for space 

how to open terminal on each OS 
MAC Applications -> Utilities as a short cut you can press on command + space .
Linux  Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. 
Windows  SSH client. you can download Putty and its free(free)  

Bash/shell/echo to display massages.

also linux stored short cut in history so we can use it when ever we need it .

PWD print working directory.
LS to bring list ,-L long list ,/ect directories contents.

A path means to get particular file or directory and there is two tyops of paths absolute and relative, we can use one of them if we need a file or directory.

if we want to bring  root directory we should use / .
~ (tilde) home directory.
. (dot)  current directory
.. (dotdot)-parent directory
cd change directory to move around they system //cd[location] if we didnt use arguments  it will always take you back to your home directory.
Ls-a to bring list and hidden files 

Liunx is a Extension less system it will ignore any extensions and it will work fine without it file[path] .file.exe refer to file or a program ,file.png, file.gif, file.jpg refer 
to image ,file.txt - refer to text file.

Linux is Case Sensitive for upper and lower case and we have watch out what we write ,every thing at Linux is a file even the directory .
if we want to create a hidden file all we have to name it a.
