##  Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### whats a Domin Modeling
A domain model is a system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a sphere of knowledge, influence or activity (a domain). The domain model is a representation of meaningful real-world concepts pertinent to the domain that need to be modeled in software.

>Html Tables:
- Use the HTML <table> element to define a table.
- Use the HTML <tr> element to define a table row.
- Use the HTML <td> element to define a table data.
- Use the HTML <th> element to define a table heading.
- Use the HTML <caption> element to define a table caption.
- Use the CSS border property to define a border. 

HTML tables are used for displaying data that make sense in spreadsheet software. They consist of rows and columns and are often used on websites for the effective displaying of tabular data.

To left-align the table headings, use css text-align property.

### Functions, Methods, and Objects 

>JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

> a function object is a construct allowing an object to be invoked or called as if it were an ordinary function, usually with the same syntax (a function parameter that can also be a function).

>> A method, like a function, is a set of instructions that perform a task. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not.

>> Methods are actions or codes which perform particular tasks. An object is an instance of the class which have all the properties of that class.

>>The name of the constructor must be the same as the name of the class. Unlike methods, constructors are not considered members of a class. A constructor is called automatically when a new instance of an object is created.

This keyword:This  a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function,
In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
