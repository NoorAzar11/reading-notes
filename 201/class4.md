2. Creating site layouts
3. Designing for different sized screens

There are five different position values:

- static : elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties ex.position: static;.
- relative position: relative;
- fixed A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located,position: fixed; .
- absolute position: absolute;
- sticky An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.


HTML primitives. Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows

Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  </div>

Grid Columns
The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.

Grid Gaps
The spaces between each column/row are called gaps

 ** Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling)**

### Functions, Methods, and Objects

A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

JavaScript a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A function can be defined using function keyword and can be executed using () operator. A function can include one or more parameters.
