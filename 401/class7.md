### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science  ) ?

- Singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation,also Singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance.

2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes?
- Node. js modules can behave like Singletons, but they are not guaranteed to be always singleton.

3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- Layers approach that means layer-by-layer approach allows use of the properties of each material to enhance the properties of the combination.


#### Document the following Vocabulary Terms 

1. Router Middleware => Its a piece of code that comes in the middle of request and response
2. Dynamic Module Loading => Its function-like form of import that returns a promise of the requested module
3. Singleton Pattern=> Its a design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance
4. CRUD -> REST Method Matches => put to updete and create post delete item and get to read . 
5. Mock Testing=>  Its an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules.

### Preparation Materials :

1. Securing Passwords => 
- Will Passwords must have minimum length of 8 characters, Also common maximum length is 64 characters.
- Require re-authentication for sensitive features.


2. Basic Auth => 
-  Its a method for an HTTP user agent to provides a user name and password when they  making a request.
- In basic HTTP authentication, request contains a header field in the form of Authorization.
