##  AWS: S3 and Lambda

- Amazon S3 service is used for file storage, where you can upload or remove files. ... AWS Lambda has a handler function which acts as a start point for AWS Lambda function. The handler has the details of the events.

## Describe “The Cloud” 

1. Describe “The Cloud”=> 
- term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.

1. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
- a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

2. What is auto-scaling?
- Autoscaling, also spelled auto scaling or auto-scaling, and sometimes also called automatic scaling, is a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm

3. What is bandwidth?
- measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps)

4. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
- start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms 

1. Server Instances=>collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance
2. Containers => standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
3. Cloud Services => services available via a remote cloud computing server rather than an on-site server 
4. Cloud Architecture  => way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network

5. AWS => amazon web services to build, Deploy, and Manage Websites, Apps or Processes On AWS' Secure, Reliable Network. Sign Up for a Free Account & Experience AWS' Secure

6. EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku => Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment 



## Preparation Materials

- AWS S3 =>  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

- AWS Lambda =>  serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner
