## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are serverless functions? 
 - programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easie

2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

- Open the Functions page on the Lambda console.
   1. Choose Create function.
  2. Under Basic information, do the following:
   - For Function name, enter my-function.
    - For Runtime, confirm that Node.js 14.x is selected. Note that Lambda provides runtimes for .NET (PowerShell, C#), Go, Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

 3. Describe how a CDN works
 - CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user. ... Without a CDN, content origin servers must respond to every single end user request .



### Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Term

2. Cloud Storage=> Object storage for companies of all sizes.
3. CDN => (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user 

### Preparation Materials

- AWS API Gateway Overview => 

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. ... Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.
