## Implementation: Graphs
-  graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges .

 - terminology :

  1. Vertex : "also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices".

  2. Edge => connection between two node.

  3. Neighbor =>  are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
  4. Degree =>the number of edges connected to that vertex.

  - An undirected graph is a set of nodes and a set of links between the nodes. Each node is called a vertex, each link is called an edge, and each edge connects two vertices. The order of the two connected vertices is unimportant. An undirected graph is a finite set of vertices together with a finite set of edges.

  - A directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. In contrast, a graph where the edges are bidirectional is called an undirected graph.
