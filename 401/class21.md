 ###  Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Rendering=> its a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.
- Templates=> sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces. React templates may contain full-fledged pages with a pre-built design, component compositions, stand-alone components, styling (like fonts, colors theme effects, background styles, icons), plugins, widgets, libraries 
- State=> instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component


- React => React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications .

- JSX => JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
