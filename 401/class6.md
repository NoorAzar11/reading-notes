- Terminology: Linked Lists :

- ### Types of Linked List 

1. Singly Linked List:  Item navigation is forward only,that means there is only one reference, and the reference points to the next node in a linked list
2. Doubly Linked List:  Item can be navigated forward and backward.
3. Circular Linked List.

## Basic Operations For Linkedlist

1. Insertion : Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

2.  Deletion:  Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

3.  Display :  Displays the complete list.

4. Search : Searches an element using the given key.

5.  Delete : Deletes an element using the given key.

### what even is Big O? 


1.  Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

2.  Type of Big O in linked list :

-  O(1) function takes constant time ,which is to say that it doesnâ€™t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is.it  always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm.

- O(n) function , the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
