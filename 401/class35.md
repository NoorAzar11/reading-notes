### Review, Research, and Discussion
In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”?

- Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file. Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. Redux Toolkit’s goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?

- easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience. It can be added at the start of a new project, or used as part of an incremental migration in an existing project

- Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Term

1. redux toolkit slices=> slices Redux slice is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature of application. Redux state is typically organized into slices, defined by the reducers that are passed to combineReducers

2. namespace=>a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified
