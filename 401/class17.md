### Review, Research, and Discussion 

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle?
- The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app.

2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC?
- its server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.

3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
- push changes or updates from one deployment environment to another. When setting up a website you will always have your live website, which is called the live environment or production environment.
