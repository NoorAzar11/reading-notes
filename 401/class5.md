## Data Modeling 

### Review, Research, and Discussion :

- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development :

1. TDD reduces the time required for project development.
2. Save project costs in the long run.
3. Code flexibility and easier maintenance.

- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite? 
 beforeEach() ,afterEach() => beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests

 - What is one downside of Test Driven Development ? 
 slow process,That means you need an extra time for straight forward implementations,Also we have writing large tests.

 - Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
 1. Will classes define a type which can be instantiated at runtime, But  prototype itself is an object instance.
 2. The inheretence is much more effecient and simple with ES6 classes.

- Why REST?
1. First REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
2. Easy to Understand and Implement

### Term : 

1. functional programming => Its a process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. 
2. object-oriented programming (OOP) => programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 
3. class =>Its defines the variables and methoed common to all object of certain kind.
4. super=> It refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
5. this=> It refers to the object it belongs to,also it can Pass an argument in the constructor call
6. Test Driven Development (TDD)=> Its a style of programming in three activities=> 1. coding, 2. testing , 3. design 
7. Jest => Its testing Framework with a focus on simplicity,also It allows you to write tests with an approachable.
8. Continuous Integration (CI)=> Its  merging all developers working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
9. REST =>Its a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. 
10. Data Model =>Its model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another .


### Preparation Materials 

- SQL =>  
1.  We access and manipulate databases .
2. Structured Query Language  .

- sql vs nosql :
