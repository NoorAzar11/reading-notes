## AWS: Events

- A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by AWS services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus.

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server?
- Amazon’s API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few clicks you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application. Amazon API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version managemen

2. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each ?

3. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
- Standard queues guarantee that a message is delivered at least once and duplicates can be introduced into the queue. FIFO queues ensure a message is delivered exactly once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it; duplicates are not introduced into the queue.

4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
- TCP ensures that packets have been delivered to connection peer, and will retransmit until they are, that only handles failures at the network layer. Acknowledgements and confirms indicate that messages have been received and acted upon by the peer application. An acknowledgement signals both the receipt of a message, and a transfer of ownership where the receiver assumes full responsibility for it
